Birthday Paradox
=============

This small project validates the Birthday paradox problem by running simulation for n times.
n could be entered by user else default value of 10,000 is used. Simulation is done to find 
probability of having birthday of two person on same day in a year.

Following formula is used to find probability:
Success[i]/trials
Where, i is day of year, success[i] is number of successes at ith day and trials is number of trials conducted.

This project gives output by plotting the graph. For plotting JFreeChart API is used which could be downloaded from
